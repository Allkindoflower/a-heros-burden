The Story
You find yourself inside an abandoned cabin in the woods. The interior is devastated, like there was a huge struggle here. On the floor, a rusty switchblade lies next to a bloody note:

"I know why I did this, but still, my burden is too much to bear."

You decide whether to pick up the blade or leave it behind — a choice that will follow you through what’s to come.

Outside, rain chills your bones as you walk the path leading out of the cabin. Between the trees, you see a strange humanoid creature digging the ground. You must decide: attack, avoid, or try to communicate.

As you move forward, your burden grows or shrinks depending on your choices, reflecting the weight of your past actions. Eventually, you find yourself in front of an ancient temple, facing a sacrificial altar marked with symbols: “Judgement,” “Guilt,” and “Redemption.”

Here, the true test begins — will you carry your burden with strength, be consumed by it, or find a way to be redeemed?

Endings vary based on your choices, reflecting the complexity of what it means to be human.
